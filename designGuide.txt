General JS Rules:
--------------------------------------------
-Variables should be nouns.
-Functions/Methods should be verbs/adjectives.
    -Example: var car = {}
                car.isDriving = function() {};

-if doing an ajax call inside a function, then that function needs to ONLY be in charge of grabbing data AND must return the Promise of the Ajax call.
    ie.
            function getPlaylist() {
                return $.ajax().then();
            }

-try to use const/let instead of var.
-You can write your own Helper functions for helping you to write a function that was specified by our pseudocode. These helper functions don't have to be agreed upon by the group as a whole.
